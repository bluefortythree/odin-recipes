    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is a sourdough pizza recipe developed and mastered by myself. You take your favorite kind of bread (doesn't have to be sourdough) and toast it until crisp. Usually, this is about four minutes on each side but each toaster oven is different. Then you put on the pizza sauce, pepperonis or whatever other toppings you may want, and cheese. Toast again until the cheese is browned and perfect. Add some red pepper flakes if desired and enjoy.</p>
